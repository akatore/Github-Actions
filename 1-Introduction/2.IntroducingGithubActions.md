Github Actions is a powerful and flexible platform provided by GitHub, It allows developers to automate tasks directly from their repositories.
We can quickly create workflows to impliment CI/CD pipeline that build test on every pull request and deploy merge pull request to the production right beside our codebase.

Out of the box the code can be executed in different operating systems, like ubuntu, Windows and Macs.

And few advantages of Github actions are that, Github manages the infrastructure for us, which includes :
* Setting up the servers
* Scaling resources
* Managing execution environment for the Workloads

Our task is write workflow configuration in YAML files and github actions handles the rst of the tasks which includes:
* Executing the tasks in virtual machines
* caching necessary dependencies
* providing reports on the outcomes.

Finally the (workflow) Automation also helps us:
* streamline development,
* reduce manual errors,
* Increase the efficiency for software development workflow

SO the **actions** solely used for automating CI/CD pipelines building testing and releasing the code, NO!

GitHub actions goes beyond just CI/CD,

It lets ypu run workflows when other events happen in the repository it can be used for automating all kind of repository actions by listening to event such as push events issues, pull request, GitHub registry package events, or whenever a issue or a pull request gets updated. (these are just few, more are their)

-------

The core component of GitHub actions is a workflow. 

A workflow is an automated process capable of executing one or more task. This **workflows are defined using YAML files** and are located in the `./github/workflows` within your repositories, **a repository can have multiple workflows**, each of which runs in response to a specific event occurring in your repository.

For instance, **a simple event like pushing code to the repository triggers the workflow**. 

And within each workflow you define one or more jobs. A **job** consists of **a series of individual steps** which are executed on a runner, and a **runner is nothing but a virtual machine**, which is **responsible for executing your workflows upon triggering**.

GitHub automatically provision runners for each job based on the runs on configuration specified at the job level.

For example, The job name unit testing that runs three different missions. It runs on Windows, Ubuntu and Mac. Consequently, GitHub actions will provision three virtual missions for this shop, and this VMs are known as **GitHub hosted runners**. So GitHub is going to host Linux and Windows Runner on, Microsoft Azure platform while Mac runners are hosted in Gihub's own MacOs Cloud, in this particular example all the runners are hosted provisioned and operated in parallel.

And after the runners are up and running, they start executing the steps, which are defined within the job. So in this example workflow, there are three steps and these steps are executed in series. 

First, the runners will clone the repository locally on the virtual machine, then the proceed to install node.js and set up the necessary environment. And lastly, the node JS tests are executed. 

So this same steps are executed on all the three runners concurrently, and consequently, if one runner completes all the step executions, it'll be marked as successful even if the other runners are still in progress of executing their remaining steps. 

The workflow as a whole is marked as successful only once all these three runners have completed the task successfully.

So during or after the job execution, you can access the logs outputs and any artifacts for each Step via the GitHub user interface. So this information is often received from the runners where the jobs gets executed. So within the GitHub repository, so we can simply navigate to the action step to inspect the logs and the artifacts. 

So here, the unit testing job has been executed on three different machines, and we can review the logs of each of them individually. 

So this is going to allow for detailed debugging of the workflow progress and also to check the results and if the job generates any artifacts we access and download them from this page as well. So GitHub action provides a convenient interface for managing and retrieving any artifacts produced during this workflows execution. 

And it's going to enhance the overall visibility and the usability of your automated processes. 

So now that we talked about runners, so let's understand the types of runners. So we have two types of runners:
* GitHub hosted runners, and
* the self-hosted runners.
So let's try to explore the key differences between them.
